string = "Welcome to America!"
a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]
#QUESTION: What is the value of a, b, and c in this program?

# strings are (can be treated as?) arrays, so indexes does work.
# a has been assigned to "e"
# b has been assigned to "A"
# c has been assigned to nil -- there is no 18th member in the string array

puts a
puts b
puts c
