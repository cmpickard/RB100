#1. x = 2
#evaluates to 2

#2. puts x = 2
#evaluates to nil -- all puts statements return nil

#3. p name = "Joe"
#"Joe" -- the method p, unlike puts, BOTH outputs its argument and returns its argument

#4. four = "four"
#evaluates to the strig "four", so returns "four"

#5. print something = "nothing"
#nil - print commands work like puts, when it comes to returning nil
