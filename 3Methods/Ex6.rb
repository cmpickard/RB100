#This error message tells us that the program is making a call to a method named 'calculate_product'
#but the program only passed in one argument, instead of two.
#the method definition presumably has 2 parameters (and those parameters are NOT given a default value?)
#so if you call the method and only pass in one argument, the method can't run and you throw an error
